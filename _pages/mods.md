`esp-parser` is a Python library for parsing Bethesda `.esp` and `.esm` files from Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas,

## The Lone Ranger Alternative Start (coming soon)

In this Fallout New Vegas mod you start as The Lone Ranger from the 1950s TV show.
Guarding "Courier Six" as he makes his way to Freeside, you're ambushed by a group of Great Khans and left for dead. 
With your signature hat and eye mask, plus NCR Ranger armour and a cowboy repeater,
find out who attacked you and finish the courier's mission in their place.
