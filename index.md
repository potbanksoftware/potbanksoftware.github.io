1. Click this button.
  - [![Use this template](https://img.shields.io/badge/Generate-Use_this_template-2ea44f)](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/jekyll-themed-site-quickstart/generate)
2. Go to repo _Settings_ and enable as a GitHub Pages site.
3. Go to the _environment_ tab to check the status of the build and then get the URL of your GitHub Pages site.


## Choose a theme

### Built-in

It is easy to use one of standard themes available of GitHub Pages by setting the theme value in your config. 

There are about 10 and are listed among gems here:

- https://pages.github.com/versions/

You can also switch between themes with a preview, by switching themes within repo Settings 

### Custom 

If you want to use another theme on a GH Pages site, you must use the Remote Theme plugin and point to a GitHub repo.

See this project, which uses that approach and explains it.

- https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/jekyll-theme-quickstart/tree/gh-pages

Or you must use another CI flow like GitHub Actions or Netlify. Then you can put any theme in your config file under `theme`, as long as you also cover it in `Gemfile`.


## Set up locally

This project is not intended to be run locally with a dev server.

See this project, which has instructions and a `Gemfile` which are suited for local development.
